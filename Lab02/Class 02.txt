Class 02 Lecture Notes

Javascript

- loosely typed, we dont have to know the type of data we are going to use to declare a variable

- dynamic language, can change the data type after a variable has been declared.

Data Types

-String

  Sequence of characters used to represent text, written in single quotes
    - 'hello'

-Numbers

  Numerical type
    - full numbers, decimals, negatives

-Booleans

  logical data type
    - true or false
    - truthy/falsey

-Undefined

  it hasn't been defined yet

-Null


   condition
if(amIHungry){
  eat;
} 
else if(amIThirsty){
  drink water;
}
else {
  take a nap;
}

Truthy and Falsey

NUMBERS 
0 - is the only falsey value
ANY OTHER NUMBER IS TRUTHY

STRINGS
'' is the only falsey value 
ANY OTHER STRING IS TRUTHY 

Comparison Operators

ex: >=, <=, >, <
=== - STRICTLY EQUALS - OUR WORLD!!!!!!
!== STRICTLY NOT EQUALS
== - LOOSELY EQUALS OR COMPARATIVE EQUALS - NOT OUR WORLD!
!= LOOSELY NOT EQUAL

let a = '5';

console.log(a == 5);
console.log(a >= '5');

Logical Operators  

ex: AND - && 
    OR - ||
    ! - NOT - opposite of whatever it is in front of 

    console.log(!true)

    if(a === 5 && a < 10){ *if both are true the code will run*
      console.log('will this run?');
    }

   if('' && 'hello'){ 
      console.log('will this run?');
    }
